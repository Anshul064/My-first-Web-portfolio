<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi,My name is Anshul Thakur and i started learning Html basics just a day before.Learning it is easy but keeping track of things is a little bit hectic,so many things to keep track of and if you miss some important point.
  Then check it all at on.
</p>

<p>I'm currently doing my studies as a B-Tech Student pursuing CSE in SRM Institute of Science and Technology.At last at third year i thought of learning a skill(At Last don't know why this thought didn't come before),that came boost my resume/portfolio,I have also Tried different fields like Maching Learning and Some basics concepts about Neural Network.</p>

<p>Motivation to do something is not really my genre.I get Bored from things at an early stage.First,I started gaming and wasted my whole 3 precious years in them,Valorant an addictive piece of shit will make your time fly like a jet,you won't even know when to stop.I am against or thinks that gaming is addictive or bad but having a time management is the most important thing.You should follow or otherwise you would also end up being doing projects or doing Competitive programming in the last years of your college.</p>
